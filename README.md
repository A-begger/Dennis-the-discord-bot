# Dennis-the-discord-bot
Dennis is a discord bot that uses OpenAI to simulate as a AI chatbot that is a discord bot that anyone can talk to.



Installation:
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Additionally, create a .env file and place your discord bot auth token like this 
`auth = "auth token"` (keep the speechmarks and place the authtoken inside).
Also create a openai.env file and place your open ai token inside, only the token must be placed inside with no speechmarks or anything.

In the same folder as app.py or bot.py, create a text file caled mrq.txt. (This is to allow the bot to access the most recently asked question.)
